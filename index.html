<p><strong>Text: </strong>Lambert.  <i>Fundamentals of Python: First Programs</i> <strong>ISBN: </strong>9781111822705</p>

<p><strong>Other Required Materials:</strong> Raspberry Pi Computer Kit with Raspbian Linux and Python 3 installed.  This
    will be supplied to the student at no cost. Also, a <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account will be required
    for submitting homework. Instructions and tutorials will be covered very early in the term.</p>

<p><strong>Other Suggested Materials:</strong> A USB flash drive or cloud storage (e.g. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>,
    <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/">OneDrive</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/dr ive/">Google Drive</a>)
    for keeping backups of all work.  Student work will also be stored on GitHub as this will be the primary class location.</p>

<p><b>Course Fulfillment:</b>This course will fulfill elective credits for the Liberal Education STEM Emphasis AA program.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>MATH 150, ITECH 150, or instructor approval.</p>

<p><b>Course Description: </b>This course is an introduction to programming (algorithmic problem solving). We will cover
    algorithm development in an abstract way and then we will use the Python 3 programming language and a version of the Linux
    operating system called Debian. This class will cover various topics, including object-oriented, functional, and interactive
    programming.  Students will gain experience designing, writing, and debugging simple programs.</p>

<b>Course Objectives: </b>
<ul>
    <li>Understand some of the history and theory behind computers and programming languages.</li>
    <li>Become literate in the Python programming language.</li>
    <li>Be able to spot a problem that can be solved in an algorithmic way.</li>
    <li>Be able to spot a problem that can <em>not</em> be solved in an algorithmic way.</li>
    <li>Be able to plan, design, and implement a simple computer program from first principles.</li>
    <li>Explore the socio-cultural impact of algorithmic problem solving and its implications.</li>
</ul>

<b>Course Metrics:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Attend each class and learn the steps to complete various computer tasks.</li>
    <li>Complete assigned exercises to develop skills.</li>
    <li>Apply knowledge to everyday situations.</li>
    <li>Be tested regularly on material covered in class.</li>
</ul>

<b>Course Policies:</b>
<ul>

    <li>
        <p><b>What to expect: </b>Generally, classes will consist of a combination of instruction and "lab" time. If enrollment
            is high enough, students will work in pairs using a system called "pair programming." Otherwise, we will do a
            combination of "class programming" and solo work..</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Attendance: </b>As you are no doubt aware, attendance is absolutely critical to success everywhere. Sometimes
            the text will be missing steps or procedures or other material (there are actually some deprecated methods in the text!).
            I will even be deviating from the text periodically to address wider issues and demonstrate newer technologies and
            methods of interacting with today's technological world. Thus, attendance is not only highly advised, but, in fact, mandatory.
            I think it's also important to address the issue of tardiness. I start class immediately at the designated time.
            So please do try to be in class on time. Sometimes it takes several minutes to set up the Raspberry Pi, and if
            you are late, that can derail the plans for the day.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Disabilities Act: </b>In compliance with the American Disabilities Act, Leech Lake Tribal College will make every
            effort to provide equal access for persons with disabilities. If you need any accommodation due to disability, please
            contact me or the Dean of Students in the Student Services Building at 335-4276.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>The Learning Center:</b> provides free learning assistance and resources for all LLTC classes. Students can work independently
            or in small groups while having access to trained peer mentors. No appointments necessary. I will also have some scheduled office hours
            each week, where I would be happy to help out with any questions you might have.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p><b>Plagiarism, Academic Dishonesty, and Disruptive Behavior:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plagiarism: </strong>See "Academic Integrity" in the College Catalogue & Student Handbook.  I understand that often there is a lack of understanding of just what plagiarism is, and I will work with students on a case-by-case basis when addressing these concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Conduct: </strong>"Student Code of Conduct" in the Student Handbook has information as well. Honestly, this is college, I think we can handle this.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology: </strong>This class is in a room full of computers and the temptation to surf the internet,
                check your Twitter or browse your Facebook can be great. But remember, during instruction time, paying attention
                is critical. So please, do try to be adults and exercise a certain amount of self-control.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Electronics: </strong>The same goes for cell-phones and smartphones.  Bottom line, be a grown-up.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>


<p><b>Evaluation:</b> (This is a rough guideline, subject to change
<ul>
    <li>Section Tests - Weight 3 - There will be 2-4 section tests.</li>
    <li>Exams - Weight 1 - There will be a mid-term and final.</li>
    <li>Attendance - Weight 0 - Attendance will be used to adjust grades that are on the edge of two letter grades.</li>
    <li>Term Project - Weight 2 - There will be one large-ish term project.</li>
    <li>General Assignments - Weight 4 - Your daily work will account for around 50-60% of your final grade.</li>
</ul>

    <b>Tentative Course Outline:</b> Below is a basic schedule of topics to be covered in the course. As with all things, aspects of this are subject to change as we move through the
    material and different things come up.  I do not expect to deviate significantly, though.  All assignments will be submitted electronically, and all grading and feedback will, likewise,
    be electronically submitted.  This is a technology class after all.  <b>I do not need or want paper copies of any assignments</b>.</p>
